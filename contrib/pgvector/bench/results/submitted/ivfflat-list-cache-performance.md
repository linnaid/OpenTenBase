# IVFFlat list-directory cache performance report

[中文报告](ivfflat-list-cache-performance_ZH.md)

Date: 2026-09-11

## Summary

This experiment compares the type-aware distance-dispatch baseline at commit
`0b16fb5bd0` with an IVFFlat list-directory cache candidate. The candidate
caches immutable list centers and entry start pages in the backend-local
relation cache (`rd_amcache`). It does not cache query results or heap TIDs.

Across the four measured configurations, median average latency decreased by
0.95% to 2.97% and median TPS increased by 0.97% to 3.06%. Recall@10, returned
item counts, matched item counts, and failed transaction counts were unchanged
in all 12 baseline/candidate pairs.

The result supports the cache as a small, low-risk scan-path optimization. It
does not support a claim larger than about 3% from this experiment, and the
short 15-second samples should be followed by a longer confirmation run.

## Compared builds

| Variant | Source | vector.so SHA-256 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Baseline | `0b16fb5bd0` | `c4b17e53576e25958ab152f9d7550c41f534ce1eaf077cd8fcc5c2f2953de67d` |
| Candidate | uncommitted list-directory cache candidate | `2591f41c656b3f1c4924a3a8fffaefc05e85f6fe3e0d12a1b1500e1449733ef8` |

Both modules were built with the same PostgreSQL installation and `COPT=-O2`.
The benchmark reused the same physical IVFFlat index across the two variants.

## Median results

Each row reports the median of three repetitions.

| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |

## Correctness gate

All 12 repetition-level comparisons passed:

- comparison status: 12/12 matched;
- Recall@10 change: 0.000000 in every row;
- failed transactions: 0 on both variants;
- returned items: 10,000 on both variants;
- matched items: identical on both variants.

The implementation also passed the existing IVFFlat vector, halfvec, and bit
SQL regression tests. Manual same-session checks returned 100 rows before and
after cache reuse, after an insert, and after `REINDEX`.

## Why the gain is modest

The cache removes repeated buffer lookup, pin, shared-lock, page-item traversal,
and unlock operations for IVFFlat list-directory pages. For 1,000 lists at 128
dimensions, the directory is roughly 65 to 70 index pages and the backend-local
cache is about 0.5 MiB.

The optimization does not remove list-center distance calculations, candidate
page reads, distance calculations for candidates, tuple materialization, or
tuplesort. Those operations continue to dominate when probes increases. This
explains why the measured whole-query improvement is in the 1% to 3% range.

## Variance and limitations

Individual 15-second repetitions ranged from a 6.02% latency regression to an
8.64% improvement. These extremes did not persist across all three repetitions;
the median result is therefore used instead of the best run.

Current limitations:

- only L2 was measured;
- samples ran for 15 seconds rather than the final 60-second gate;
- Recall@10 was low at probes 1 and 10, so this is primarily a scan-overhead
  experiment rather than a high-recall production configuration;
- no phase-level `GetScanLists` timing was captured;
- no cold-cache, 1M-row, halfvec, or lists sweep was run;
- the candidate did not yet have a commit hash during measurement.

## Conclusion

The list-directory cache passes the correctness gate and shows a consistent
positive median result in every measured configuration. The most stable and
largest median benefit was at probes 10 with one client: latency decreased by
2.97% and TPS increased by 3.06%.

Before making a final performance claim, rerun the representative configurations
for 60 seconds with three repetitions and add probes 20. A result around 1% to
3% should be reported as a targeted reduction in IVFFlat list-selection
overhead, not as a broad end-to-end acceleration.
